hi nia! ðŸ¤“

i think i have created a new line of profession trying to find multiple ways to communicate with you, im pretty sure this is the craziest 
thing ive done in a very very very long time. using github to text the whimsy uncanny valley ghosting girl is a very balls of steel thing
to do. i dont know if my push will get through but if youre reading this, please reply ðŸ˜­ somewhere i wont ask anything else actually.
also i like your repos. 

bye,
kri
